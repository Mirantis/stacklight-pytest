Tests to check stacklight

Prerequisites:
==============

Code requirements:
------------------
Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`


Build and install as python package
===================================
Build dist with next command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py sdist
    # or:
    tox -e build

Run install on target machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dist/stacklight_tests-1.0.tar.gz --process-dependency-links

where `--process-dependency-links` flag is necessary.


Installing dependencies and system packages
===========================================
To install system packages run:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev libyaml-dev python-dev python-pip

Create and activate virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv ../venv-stacklight-test
    source ../venv-stacklight-test/bin/activate

Install dependencies, if you aren't using this project as package:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run tests
=========

In case of using MK2x it worth generating config from mk env to run tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    PYTHONPATH=".:$PYTHONPATH" python stacklight_tests/config/mk_config.py

or run:


.. code-block:: bash

    stl-tests gen-config-mk

if you have stacklight_tests installed.

To view initial tests in test_alerts.py just type 'pytest'. They are using
default settings from deployment. Later it is going to be configured.


Notes
=====

The difference between our fixture `destructive`
with its method `.append(callable_recovery)` usage
and pytest built-in `request` with method `.addfinalizer(callable)`
is in post conditions: `destructive` makes his work only on fail,
`finalizer` makes it in any case.
So, use destructive, when reverting of something broken is made in test itself,
and finalizer when it is not.
